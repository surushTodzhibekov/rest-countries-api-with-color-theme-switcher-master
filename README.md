Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### Useful resources

- [React useContext](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - This helped me for setting dark mode in app.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - This is helped me to review some types and implement it. I'd recommend it to anyone still checking documentation.
